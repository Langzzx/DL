## Course Notes
1. Intro Neural Networks

  1.1 [Sentiment networks](.Notes/Sentiment_Classification_Projects-Ex.ipynb): 
  > Use sentiment as example intro NN basic, like BP/SGD/ and some interesting idea of process the data and skill imporved accuracy and efficiency.
2. Convolutional Neural Networks
3. Recurrent Neural Networks
4. Generative Adversarial Networks
