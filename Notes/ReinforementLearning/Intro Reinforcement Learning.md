# Intro Reinforcement Learning
branch of machine learning is about training an agent by giving it rewards for performing correct actions, successful apply in Alpha Go

## Q-learning:
Q-table choose actions,
Belloman equation:
  Q(s, a) = r(s) + gamma(max(Q(s', a')))

OpenAI Gym:
> A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It supports teaching agents everything from walking to playing games like Pong or Go.

Actions -> Q-table
